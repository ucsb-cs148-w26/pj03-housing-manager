## Background

Many UCSB students are suffering from a [housing crisis][link_1] caused by rising rent costs and a limited number of available apartments, which cannot keep pace with the growing student population.

Landlords face their own challenges: advertising apartments across multiple platforms is time-consuming, and potential tenants often find listings through random Google searches or word-of-mouth referrals, making the process inefficient for both parties.

The **Housing Manager** project is intended to address this problem by making an all-in-one site for housing needs. 

## Intended Users

### Primary Tenent / Leaser

**Who?** 

Students or other individuals looking for long-term or quarter-based housing. They need an easy way to browse, filter, and secure apartments in Isla Vista and nearby areas.

**How this app helps them:** 

Students may risk living in unsuitable or unsafe conditions because options were not easily verifiable.

### Subleaser

**Who?** 

Students looking to temporarily sublease their apartments, such as during study abroad programs or summer breaks. They need a trusted platform to find short-term renters.

**How this app helps them:** 

Students likely would have trouble finding short-term renters, resulting in financial loss if their apartment sits vacant.

### Landlord

**Who?** 

Individuals or companies renting out apartments. They want a single platform to advertise listings efficiently and reach a larger pool of prospective tenants.

**How this app helps them:** 

Landloards waste time posting the same apartment on multiple platforms. Additionally, they may not reach the right tenants, leading to higher turnover or unreliable renters.

### Roommate Seeker

**Who?** 

Students searching for compatible roommates to share housing for lower rent rates. They benefit from a platform that allows profiles, preferences, and direct communication with potential roommates.

**How this app helps them:** 

Students who cannot afford rent on their own and who struggle to find trustworthy roommates. By matching preferences and offering direct communication, this app makes finding roommates easier and more reliable.
