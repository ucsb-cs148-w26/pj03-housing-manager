### Experiment Description
I used Claude Code to help generate a documentation folder (`docs/`) for the project, specifically `docs/scrapers.md`, which explains how our scrapers work and how they are used within the system.

### Outcomes
The AI produced a clear, structured documentation draft covering the scraper purpose, usage, and workflow. This served as a strong starting point and was refined to better reflect the project’s implementation.

### Reflections on Usefulness
Claude Code was effective for quickly producing readable documentation and reducing the effort required to explain existing code. It could be useful for maintaining documentation as the project evolves.

### Ensuring Correctness, Clarity, and Fair Use
I reviewed the generated documentation against the actual scraper code to ensure accuracy and made edits where necessary. The AI output was treated as a draft and revised to ensure correctness, clarity, and appropriate use.
