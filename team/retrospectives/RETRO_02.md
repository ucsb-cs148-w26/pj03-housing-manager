* Led by: Alex Yoon 
* Present: Everyone is here 

## Action item

* **Goal:**  
  Discuss our goals for finalizing the login/admin features (needed for the showcasing next week) as well as trying to reorganized our codebase into cleaner bits.

* **Change / Experiment:**  
  Every single person should use the kanban board when thet start a new task, and check at the beginning of each section to see who is working on what, as well as the progress on those tasks

* **Measurement:**  
  - Visible features added to our product
  - Faster turnaround time from issue start to completion  
  - Less conflicts and fewer bugs in our code

## Retro Assessment

* **Retro process used:**  
  We used a **Start / Stop / Continue** retrospective format to identify practices the team should adopt, eliminate, or maintain.

* **Assessment of how it went:**  
  The retro went very smoothly; we ended up being very communicative about how our progress was going, and how we can improve that in the future. It seems like our codebase was getting cleaner the past few weeks as well.

* **Advice for the next retro leader:**  
  Keep the discussion on track, and prioritize what goals we want to reach in the near future.

## Experiment / Change

* **Description of the change / experiment:**  
  All the work will go through kanban, and as we each develop respective features, we will have a lot of updates throughout.

* **Assessment of results:**  
  This change improved clarity around task scope and ownership. Team members spent less time asking for clarification and more time making consistent progress on assigned tasks.

* **Decision going forward:**  
  Keep the change. Continue enforcing acceptance criteria, linked user stories, and peer reviews. Reassess task sizing and workload distribution in future retrospectives.
