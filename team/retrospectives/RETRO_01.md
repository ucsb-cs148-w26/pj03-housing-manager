## Start
- Defining clear acceptance criteria for tasks before beginning implementation
- Writing efficient user stories to create issues and sub-issues
- Setting aside time to regroup, discuss issues, and conduct peer reviews as needed
- Setting and focusing on specific goals by working on one issue per person to move toward the MVP faster
- Creating issues under clearly identified user stories

## Stop
- Letting tasks linger without ownership or a clear due date
- Writing standalone issues without a linked user story or clear direction
- Writing unclear code with improper documentation or unclear directions

## Continue
- Doing peer code reviews, as they help catch bugs and improve code quality
- Focusing on one task on the Kanban board at a time
- Splitting issues into sub-issues to create better-defined boundaries
