# Date of Retrospective: 01/24/25

* Led by: Timothy Nguyen  
* Present: Everyone is here  

## Action item

* **Goal:**  
  Improve team efficiency and code quality by ensuring tasks are clearly defined, owned, and aligned with user stories so the team can reach the MVP faster.

* **Change / Experiment:**  
  Require all tasks to be created under a clearly defined user story with explicit acceptance criteria, a single owner, and a rough due date before work begins.

* **Measurement:**  
  - Fewer issues needing rework or clarification after completion  
  - Faster turnaround time from issue start to completion  
  - Fewer bugs or major changes requested during peer code reviews

## Retro Assessment

* **Retro process used:**  
  We used a **Start / Stop / Continue** retrospective format to identify practices the team should adopt, eliminate, or maintain.

* **Assessment of how it went:**  
  The retro went smoothly and was productive. Everyone participated, and the format helped the team quickly surface concrete issues and actionable improvements.

* **Advice for the next retro leader:**  
  Keep the discussion focused on specific behaviors and outcomes, encourage concrete examples, and make sure the retro ends with a clear, actionable change rather than multiple vague goals.

## Experiment / Change

* **Description of the change / experiment:**  
  All work will be organized under user stories, with issues and sub-issues clearly scoped. Each issue must include acceptance criteria, ownership, and basic documentation. Peer code reviews remain mandatory before merging.

* **Assessment of results:**  
  This change improved clarity around task scope and ownership. Team members spent less time asking for clarification and more time making consistent progress on assigned tasks.

* **Decision going forward:**  
  Keep the change. Continue enforcing acceptance criteria, linked user stories, and peer reviews. Reassess task sizing and workload distribution in future retrospectives.
