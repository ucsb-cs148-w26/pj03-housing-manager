Hi, my name is Timothy and I am a third year CS major. My ideas on this project revolve around making a user friendly app in order to help people look for housing in IV, especially students at UCSB so they can track and manage their housing status. Features I would like to include are address lookups, housing applications open that are near UCSB (bikeable distance) as well a tracker for housing apps they have applied to.
