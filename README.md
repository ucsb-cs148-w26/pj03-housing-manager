## Project Description

Our project has no counterpart.

Our ideal users are UCSB students living in or planning to live in Isla Vista.

We will have an admin side and a normal user side. The admins will manage the info that the users input and update new data as well as regulate content. Users sohuld be able to use their preferences and search for housing easily.

The goal of the app is to have students find their ideal leasing company/house that they can live in for next year. Should fit their price budgets, location, space, etc. And should be able to choose from a plethora of different leasing companies. Our app brings together all of the leasing companies and presents easy, readable, coordinated info for the user.

Technologies: python(good basic Backend data processing and aggregation of leasing information), react(Dynamic, responsive user interface for searching and filtering housing options), node.js(API layer and server-side communication between frontend and backend), playwright(Automated scraping and testing to collect and validate leasing data)
